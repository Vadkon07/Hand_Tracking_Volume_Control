# Introduction

This app can be used if you want to change a volume of your PC without toouching a mouse or keyboard. You can just show your right hand to increase volume, and left hand to decrease volume.

It can be very useful if your laptop/PC is placed in front of pool, in the kitchen, or just if you watch a movie and want to change his volume without distracting yourself on all these buttons and switches.

## Features

1. Works offline.
2. Can be customized, has a lot of different settings inside code.
3. **Two versions!:** With first version "main_hands" you can change volume by showing your hands, and with second version "main_fingers" you can change volume by showing your index finger. "main_finger_linux" is a version which also works on Linux.
