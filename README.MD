# Introduction

This app can be used if you want to change a volume of your PC without toouching a mouse or keyboard. You can just show your right hand to increase volume, and left hand to decrease volume.

It can be very useful if your laptop/PC is placed in front of pool, in the kitchen, or just if you watch a movie and want to change his volume without distracting yourself on all these buttons and switches.

## Features

1. Works offline
2. Can be customized, has a lot of different settings inside code

## Requirements

**Specifications:** I tested it on one laptop with Intel Core i7 11 Gen + 16GB of RAM, and it works perfectly. I'm not sure about older processors, so share you experience with me!

**Packages:** You have to install some packages as cv2 and mediapipe, it's necessary to make this app able to work.

**Operational System:** Probably for now it works only on Windows, but soon we will solve it!

**Web Camera:** It's better if this camera is 720p+. Probably it also works with DSLR cameras, check it.

## To-Do

- [ ] Add mute if input is with both hands in one time
- [ ] Improve accuracy
- [ ] Maybe add something for face detection
- [ ] Optimise for Linux (on Acer Aspire One D260 with installed Arch Linux I got next error: Illegal instruction (core dumped)
